1. Inspect the Page: Right-click on the web page and select “Inspect” (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I). This opens the browser’s developer tools.

2. Explore Elements: In the developer tools, navigate to the “Elements” or “Inspector” tab. This section displays the HTML structure of the page.

3. Dropdowns and Elements: Look for dropdown menus or other interactive elements. Click on them to expand and explore their contents.

4. Unusual Content: Pay attention to anything that stands out. It could be hidden text, comments, or unexpected elements. Sometimes, flags are cleverly hidden within the HTML code.

5. Flag Identification: Once you find something unusual, examine it closely. If it resembles a flag (e.g., starts with “flag{”), you’ve likely found it!

Remember, HTML challenges often involve creative thinking and careful observation. Happy hunting! 🕵️‍♂️🚩
